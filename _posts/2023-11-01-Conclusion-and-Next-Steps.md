Our Stirling Engine successfully operated. Once started the engine would continue to spin, as shown in the video.

## Future Work
In the future, we aim to make iterations on this design with two improvements:

#### Storing Power
While we have designed and fabricated an incredibly nice-looking assembly, the next step for this project would be to store energy from the engine. Having the ability to charge a device, such as a phone, gives the engine functionality.

#### Scaling
With the desire so next store power, another next step is to scale the model. Scaling the model can either involve increasing the number of pistons, or making the pistons larger. The goal of this next step is to increase the power output of the system.
