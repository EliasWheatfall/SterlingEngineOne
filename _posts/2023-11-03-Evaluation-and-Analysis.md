## Assumptions

To tackle designing this system we needed to reduce its complexity by providing assumptions and justifications. The main assumptions we made are below:

- Steady heat in from the flame:
- leakage from the piston is negligible
- We can apply a large enough pulling force to start the system
- Efficiency of our system is 0.3 (A typical Stirling Engine is 0.4)

## Analysis

## Evaluation

## Finite Element Analysis

For this project, there were three main areas of concern we wanted to address with FEA. This includes the pressure in our fuel tank, clamping force on our flextures, and steady state response of our system.

### Fuel Tank Pressure

### Clamping Force

### Steady State Response
