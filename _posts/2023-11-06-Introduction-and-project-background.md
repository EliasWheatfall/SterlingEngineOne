Figure (1): Alpha-Type Stirling Engine

A Stirling engine is a type of closed-cycle heat engine that operates by cyclic compression. Typically a Stirling engine consists of two pistons, one hot and another cold. An external heat source provides heat to the hot end. The gas alternately expands and contracts due to changes in temperature, driving the pistons, producing mechanical work. 


## Project Objective?
The objective of our project is to create an in-depth understanding of a Stirling engine and how to manipulate aspects of the engine to develop a desired outcome. In our exploration, we have developed predictive models to influence our design including P-V diagrams, Acceleration vs time graphs, FEA, and load curves.

## Requirements and Specifications
The goal of our Engine is to

## Resources?
In our research we've found these resources to be incredibly helpful in understanding our system:
