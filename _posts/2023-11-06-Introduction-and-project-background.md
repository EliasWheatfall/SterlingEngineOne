Figure (1): Alpha-Type Stirling Engine

A Stirling engine is a type of closed-cycle heat engine that operates by cyclic compression. This system uses a regenerator, otherwise known as a heat exchanger to transfer heat from a source to the working fluid.


## Project Objective?
The objective of our project is to create an in-depth understanding of a Stirling engine and how to manipulate aspects of the engine to develop a desired outcome. In our exploration, we have developed predictive models to influence our design including P-V diagrams, Acceleration vs time graphs, FEA, and load curves.

## Resources?
In our research we've found these resources to be incredibly helpful in understanding our system:
