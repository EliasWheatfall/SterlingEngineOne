Figure (1): Alpha-Type Stirling Engine

A Stirling engine is a closed-cycle heat engine that operates by cyclic compression. Typically, a Stirling engine consists of two pistons, one hot and another cold. An external heat source provides heat to the hot end. The gas alternately expands and contracts due to temperature changes, driving the pistons and producing mechanical work.


## Project Objective?
The objective is to create an in-depth understanding of a Stirling engine and how to manipulate aspects of the engine to develop a desired outcome. In our exploration, we have developed predictive models to influence our design, including P-V diagrams, Acceleration vs time graphs, FEA, and load curves. Creating a functioning Stirling engine on its own is difficult, and achieving this goal alone is a great success! 

We aim to develop a robust Stirling Engine that can operate for 30 minutes continuously once started at 400 RPM. We want to create a novel approach to housing the engine that is well-packaged and elegant.

## Resources?
