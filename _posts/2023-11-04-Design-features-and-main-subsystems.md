## System Overview
 - Image of entire system
 - Simplified image of what's occurring
Our system is comprised of four sub-assemblies. In a high-level overview, the Burner Assembly is responsible for delivering --- to the burner, which burns a flame under the cylinder assembly. This then heats the air in the Cylinder assembly, moving the displacer. This displaces hot air into the Piston Assembly. The Piston Assembly is then pressurized, in which it can perform work and drive the Driveshaft Assembly. All of the components are held together by two plates that hold everything in a rigid and elegant manor.
