Figure (2): Top View of Assembly

Our system is comprised of five sub-assemblies. The Burner Assembly is responsible for delivering alcohol to the burner, which burns a flame under the Piston Assembly. This then displaces the cold air in the system causing the Cylinder Assembly to pressurize. The Cylinder Assembly performs work when it strokes due to the increase in pressure. All of the components are held together by two plates in the Frame Assembly, which holds everything together rigidly and elegantly.

Figure (4): Frame Assembly View

The Frame Assembly consists of 3 waterjet components and 6 standoffs. The plates provide an improvement to typical Stirling Engines as they make the assembly much more compact. The improvement also makes the system more robust, protecting internal elements from issues like falling.


## Piston Assembly

Figure (5): Piston Assembly View

The Piston Assembly consists of 7 machine components and 5 COTS components. The left side of the assembly is the hot end, which rests under the flame. The right cylinder is on the cold side. Clamped to the cold side are two flexure components that are waterjet and tapped. These components mount the assembly to the frame. A shaft is connected to a displacer internally, and on the end is a connecting point to connect to the Driveshaft Assembly. A barb is placed on the surface of the cold cylinder to connect the Piston Assembly to the Cylinder Assembly.

The Piston Assembly is the side that produces work in the system. The alternation of cold to hot air changes the pressure in the system, forcing the piston to push when there is hot air displaced.

Figure (9): Burner Assembly View

The burner assembly is a large advancement our team has made compared to most Stirling engine assemblies. In a typical system a candle or jar containing isopropyl and rope produces a flame under the hot end. The temperature difference between the hot and cold piston is a huge limiting factor in the efficiency of a Stirling engine. To fix this we created a pressure vessel that houses our denatured  fuel. This burns much better than a candle, increasing our temperature difference. Additionally, before the fuel is burned it is wound around the cool to remove radiant heat from the hot end, increasing the pressure differential
