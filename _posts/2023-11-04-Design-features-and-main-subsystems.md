## System Overview
 - Image of entire system
 - Simplified image of what's occurring
Our system is comprised of four sub-assemblies. In a high-level overview, the Burner Assembly is responsible for delivering --- to the burner, which burns a flame under the cylinder assembly. This then heats the air in the Cylinder assembly, moving the displacer. This displaces hot air into the Piston Assembly. The Piston Assembly is then pressurized, in which it can perform work and drive the Driveshaft Assembly. All of the components are held together by two plates that hold everything in a rigid and elegant manor. 

## Piston Assembly
The Piston Assembly is the side that produces work in the system. The alternation of cold to hot air changes the pressure in the system, forcing the piston to push when there is hot air displaced. 

## Cylinder Assembly
THe Cylinder Assembly contains both the hot and cold side. As the 

## Driveshaft Assembly

## Burner Assembly
The burner assembly is a large advancement our team has made compared to most Stirling engine assemblies. In a typical system a candle or jar containing isopropyl and rope produces a flame under the hot end. The temperature difference between the hot and cold piston is a huge limiting factor in the effeciency of a Stirling engine. To fix this we created a pressure vessel that houses our denatured  fuel. This burns much better than a candle, increasing our temperature difference. Additionally, before the fuel is burned it is wound around the cool to remove radiant heat from the hot end, increasing the pressure differential
